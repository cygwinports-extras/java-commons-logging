sdesc: "Bridge for several Java logging APIs"
ldesc: "The Logging package is an ultra-thin bridge between different 
logging implementations. A library that uses the commons-logging API can 
be used with any logging implementation at runtime. Commons-logging 
comes with support for a number of popular logging implementations, and 
writing adapters for others is a reasonably simple task."
